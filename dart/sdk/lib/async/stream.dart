/**
 * A source of asynchronous data events.
 *
 * A Stream provides a sequence of events. Each event is either a data event or
 * an error event, representing the result of a single computation. When the
 * Stream is exhausted, it may send a single "done" event.
 *
 * You can [listen] on a stream to receive the events it sends. When you listen,
 * you receive a [StreamSubscription] object that can be used to stop listening,
 * or to temporarily pause events from the stream.
 *
 * When an event is fired, the listeners at that time are informed.
 * If a listener is added while an event is being fired, the change
 * will only take effect after the event is completely fired. If a listener
 * is canceled, it immediately stops receiving events.
 *
 * When the "done" event is fired, subscribers are unsubscribed before
 * receiving the event. After the event has been sent, the stream has no
 * subscribers. Adding new subscribers after this point is allowed, but
 * they will just receive a new "done" event as soon as possible.
 *
 * Streams always respect "pause" requests. If necessary they need to buffer
 * their input, but often, and preferably, they can simply request their input
 * to pause too.
 *
 * There are two kinds of streams: The normal "single-subscription" streams and
 * "broadcast" streams.
 *
 * A single-subscription stream allows only a single listener during the whole
 * lifetime of the stream.
 * It holds back events until it gets a listener, and it may exhaust
 * itself when the listener is unsubscribed, even if the stream wasn't done.
 *
 * Single-subscription streams are generally used for streaming parts of
 * contiguous data like file I/O.
 *
 * A broadcast stream allows any number of listeners, and it fires
 * its events when they are ready, whether there are listeners or not.
 *
 * Broadcast streams are used for independent events/observers.
 *
 * Stream transformations, such as [where] and [skip], always return
 * non-broadcast streams. If several listeners want to listen to the returned
 * stream, use [asBroadcastStream] to create a broadcast stream on top of the
 * non-broadcast stream.
 *
 * The default implementation of [isBroadcast] returns false.
 * A broadcast stream inheriting from [Stream] must override [isBroadcast]
 * to return [:true:].

abstract class StreamTransformer<S, T> {

  /**
   * Creates a [StreamTransformer].
   *
   * The returned instance takes responsibility of implementing ([bind]).
   * When the user invokes `bind` it returns a new "bound" stream. Only when
   * the user starts listening to the bound stream, the `listen` method
   * invokes the given closure [transformer].
   *
   * The [transformer] closure receives the stream, that was bound, as argument
   * and returns a [StreamSubscription]. In almost all cases the closure
   * listens itself to the stream that is given as argument.
   *
   * The result of invoking the [transformer] closure is a [StreamSubscription].
   * The bound stream-transformer (created by the `bind` method above) then sets
   * the handlers it received as part of the `listen` call.
   *
   * Conceptually this can be summarized as follows:
   *
   * 1. `var transformer = new StreamTransformer(transformerClosure);`
   *   creates a `StreamTransformer` that supports the `bind` method.
   * 2. `var boundStream = stream.transform(transformer);` binds the `stream`
   *   and returns a bound stream that has a pointer to `stream`.
   * 3. `boundStream.listen(f1, onError: f2, onDone: f3, cancelOnError: b)`
   *   starts the listening and transformation. This is accomplished
   *   in 2 steps: first the `boundStream` invokes the `transformerClosure` with
   *   the `stream` it captured: `transformerClosure(stream, b)`.
   *   The result `subscription`, a [StreamSubscription], is then
   *   updated to receive its handlers: `subscription.onData(f1)`,
   *   `subscription.onError(f2)`, `subscription(f3)`. Finally the subscription
   *   is returned as result of the `listen` call.
   *
   * There are two common ways to create a StreamSubscription:
   *
   * 1. by creating a new class that implements [StreamSubscription].
   *    Note that the subscription should run callbacks in the [Zone] the
   *    stream was listened to.
   * 2. by allocating a [StreamController] and to return the result of
   *    listening to its stream.
   *
   * Example use of a duplicating transformer:
   *
   *     stringStream.transform(new StreamTransformer<String, String>(
   *         (Stream<String> input, bool cancelOnError) {
   *           StreamController<String> controller;
   *           StreamSubscription<String> subscription;
   *           controller = new StreamController<String>(
   *             onListen: () {
   *               subscription = input.listen((data) {
   *                   // Duplicate the data.
   *                   controller.add(data);
   *                   controller.add(data);
   *                 },
   *                 onError: controller.addError,
   *                 onDone: controller.close,
   *                 cancelOnError: cancelOnError);
   *             },
   *             onPause: subscription.pause,
   *             onResume: subscription.resume,
   *             onCancel: subscription.cancel,
   *             sync: true);
   *           return controller.stream.listen(null);
