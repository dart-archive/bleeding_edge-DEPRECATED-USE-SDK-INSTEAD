/// An [ErrorGroup] entangles the errors of multiple [Future]s and [Stream]s
/// with one another.
///
/// This allows APIs to expose multiple [Future]s and [Stream]s that have
/// identical error conditions without forcing API consumers to attach error
/// handling to objects they don't care about.
///
/// To use an [ErrorGroup], register [Future]s and [Stream]s with it using
/// [registerFuture] and [registerStream]. These methods return wrapped versions
/// of the [Future]s and [Stream]s, which should then be used in place of the
/// originals. For example:
///
///     var errorGroup = new ErrorGroup();
///     future = errorGroup.registerFuture(future);
///     stream = errorGroup.registerStream(stream);
///
/// An [ErrorGroup] has two major effects on its wrapped members:
///
/// * An error in any member of the group will be propagated to every member
///   that hasn't already completed. If those members later complete, their
///   values will be ignored.
/// * If any member of this group has a listener, errors on members without
///   listeners won't get passed to the top-level error handler.
