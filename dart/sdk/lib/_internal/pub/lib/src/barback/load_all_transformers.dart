  // In order to determine in what order we should load transformers, we need to
  // know which transformers depend on which others. This is different than
  // normal package dependencies. Let's begin with some terminology:
  //
  // * If package A is transformed by package B, we say A has a "transformer
  //   dependency" on B.
  // * If A imports B we say A has a "package dependency" on B.
  // * If A needs B's transformers to be loaded in order to load A's
  //   transformers, we say A has an "ordering dependency" on B.
  //
  // In particular, an ordering dependency is defined as follows:
  //
  // * If A has a transformer dependency on B, A also has an ordering dependency
  //   on B.
  // * If A has a transitive package dependency on B and B has a transformer
  //   dependency on C, A has an ordering dependency on C.
  //
  // The order that transformers are loaded is determined by each package's
  // ordering dependencies. We treat the packages as a directed acyclic[1] graph
  // where each package is a node and the ordering dependencies are the edges
  // (that is, the packages form a partially ordered set). We then load[2]
  // packages in a topological sort order of this graph.
  //
  // [1] TODO(nweiz): support cycles in some cases.
  //
  // [2] We use "loading a package" as a shorthand for loading that package's
  //     transformers.

  // Add a rewrite transformer for each package, so that we can resolve
  // "package:" imports while loading transformers.
