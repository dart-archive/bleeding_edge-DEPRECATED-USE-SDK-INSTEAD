/// Implements the [WebSocket] API for communicating with a running pub serve
/// process, mainly for use by the Editor.
///
/// Requests must be string-encoded JSON maps. Each request is a command, and
/// the map must have a command key:
///
///     {
///       "command": "name"
///     }
///
/// The request may also have an "id" key with any value. If present in the
/// request, the response will include an "id" key with the same value. This
/// can be used by the client to match requests to responses when multiple
/// concurrent requests may be in flight.
///
///     {
///       "command": "name",
///       "id": "anything you want"
///     }
///
/// The request may have other keys for parameters to the command. It's an
/// error to invoke an unknown command.
///
/// All responses sent on the socket are string-encoded JSON maps. If an error
/// occurs while processing the request, an error response will be sent like:
///
///     {
///       "error": "Human-friendly error message."
///       "code": "UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER"
///     }
///
/// The code will be a short string that can be used to uniquely identify the
/// category of error.
///
/// No successful response map will contain a key named "error".
