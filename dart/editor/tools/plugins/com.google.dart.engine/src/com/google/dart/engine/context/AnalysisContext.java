/**
 * The interface {@code AnalysisContext} defines the behavior of objects that represent a context in
 * which a single analysis can be performed and incrementally maintained. The context includes such
 * information as the version of the SDK being analyzed against as well as the package-root used to
 * resolve 'package:' URI's. (Both of which are known indirectly through the {@link SourceFactory
 * source factory}.)
 * <p>
 * An analysis context also represents the state of the analysis, which includes knowing which
 * sources have been included in the analysis (either directly or indirectly) and the results of the
 * analysis. Sources must be added and removed from the context using the method
 * {@link #applyChanges(ChangeSet)}, which is also used to notify the context when sources have been
 * modified and, consequently, previously known results might have been invalidated.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to access the results of the analysis. The most common is to use one of the
 * 'get' methods to access the results. The 'get' methods have the advantage that they will always
 * return quickly, but have the disadvantage that if the results are not currently available they
 * will return either nothing or in some cases an incomplete result. The second way to access
 * results is by using one of the 'compute' methods. The 'compute' methods will always attempt to
 * compute the requested results but might block the caller for a significant period of time.
 * <p>
 * When results have been invalidated, have never been computed (as is the case for newly added
 * sources), or have been removed from the cache, they are <b>not</b> automatically recreated. They
 * will only be recreated if one of the 'compute' methods is invoked.
 * <p>
 * However, this is not always acceptable. Some clients need to keep the analysis results
 * up-to-date. For such clients there is a mechanism that allows them to incrementally perform
 * needed analysis and get notified of the consequent changes to the analysis results. This
 * mechanism is realized by the method {@link #performAnalysisTask()}.
 * <p>
 * Analysis engine allows for having more than one context. This can be used, for example, to
 * perform one analysis based on the state of files on disk and a separate analysis based on the
 * state of those files in open editors. It can also be used to perform an analysis based on a
 * proposed future state, such as the state after a refactoring.
