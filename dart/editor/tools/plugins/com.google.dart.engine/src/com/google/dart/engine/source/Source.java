/**
 * The interface {@code Source} defines the behavior of objects representing source code that can be
 * analyzed by the analysis engine.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface need to be aware of some assumptions made by the analysis
 * engine concerning sources:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sources are not required to be unique. That is, there can be multiple instances representing
 * the same source.</li>
 * <li>Sources are long lived. That is, the engine is allowed to hold on to a source for an extended
 * period of time and that source must continue to report accurate and up-to-date information.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Because of these assumptions, most implementations will not maintain any state but will delegate
 * to an authoritative system of record in order to implement this API. For example, a source that
 * represents files on disk would typically query the file system to determine the state of the
 * file.
 * <p>
 * If the instances that implement this API are the system of record, then they will typically be
 * unique. In that case, sources that are created that represent non-existent files must also be
 * retained so that if those files are created at a later date the long-lived sources representing
 * those files will know that they now exist.
