/**
 * The interface {@code Element} defines the behavior common to all of the elements in the element
 * model. Generally speaking, the element model is a semantic model of the program that represents
 * things that are declared with a name and hence can be referenced elsewhere in the code.
 * <p>
 * There are two exceptions to the general case. First, there are elements in the element model that
 * are created for the convenience of various kinds of analysis but that do not have any
 * corresponding declaration within the source code. Such elements are marked as being
 * <i>synthetic</i>. Examples of synthetic elements include
 * <ul>
 * <li>default constructors in classes that do not define any explicit constructors,
 * <li>getters and setters that are induced by explicit field declarations,
 * <li>fields that are induced by explicit declarations of getters and setters, and
 * <li>functions representing the initialization expression for a variable.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Second, there are elements in the element model that do not have a name. These correspond to
 * unnamed functions and exist in order to more accurately represent the semantic structure of the
 * program.
