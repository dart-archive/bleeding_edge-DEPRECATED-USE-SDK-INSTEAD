/**
 * The interface <code>DartElement</code> defines the behavior of objects representing some element

 * underlying element. The Dart model may hand out any number of handles for each element. Handles
 * that refer to the same element are guaranteed to be equal, but not necessarily identical.
 * <p>
 * Methods annotated as "handle-only" do not require underlying elements to exist. Methods that
 * require underlying elements to exist throw a {@link DartModelException} when an underlying
 * element is missing. The method {@link DartModelException#isDoesNotExist()} can be used to
 * recognize this common special case.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
