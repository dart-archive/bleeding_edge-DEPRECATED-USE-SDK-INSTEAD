Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Organize Imports->Import...
  <DART_TRUNK>/editor/docs/dart.importorder

------------ Member sort order ------------

Window->Preferences->Java->Appearance->Members Sort Order
There is no import here, so make your settings match:
  editor/docs/dart-sort-order.png

First, members should be sorted by category.
1) Types
2) Static Fields
3) Static Initializers
4) Static Methods
5) Fields
6) Initializers
7) Constructors
8) Methods

Second, members in the same category should be sorted by visibility.
1) Public
2) Protected
3) Default
4) Private

Third, within a category/visibility combination, members should be sorted
alphabetically.

------------ Java > Compiler > Errors/Warnings ------------

Set to ignore:

- Potential programming problems > Serializable class w/o serialVersionUID
- Unnecessary Code > Parameter is never read

------------ Plug-in Development > API Baselines

Set to ignore:

- Missing API baseline

====================================
  Importing the Eclipse projects
====================================

File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

Import the existing projects in <DART_TRUNK>/editor
  including the "docs" project containing this README.txt file

====================================
  Installing Dart SDK and Dartium
====================================

For development, we require that the Eclipse installation directory have a "dart-sdk" directory
containing the bundled dart:<name> libraries (e.g. dart:core).

1) In the dart/editor/tools/features/com.google.dart.tools.deploy.feature_releng/build-settings
directory, copy the user.properties file to <username>.properties, where <username> is your
login name. Adjust the two properties in that file to point to:

  -the Dart Editor source directory (dart/editor)
  -a build output directory

2) In Eclipse, right click on build_rcp.xml in com.google.dart.tools.deploy.feature_releng
3) Select "Run As > Ant Build..."
4) Click the "Targets" tab and make sure only the "setupDevWorkspace" target is checked
5) Click the "JRE" tab and select "Run in the same JRE as the workspace"
6) Click "Run"

Alternately, you can run the Ant script outside Eclipse
by defining the "eclipse.home" property to point to your Eclipse installation

Next, install Dartium (Chromium with an embedded Dart VM) into the "dart-sdk" directory.
http://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/

Linux:
  <eclipse-install-dir>/chromium/

Mac:
  <eclipse-install-dir>/chromium/Chromium.app

Windows
  <eclipse-install-dir>/chromium/chromium.exe

====================================
  Launching the Dart Editor
====================================

Once your projects have been imported, pull down the "Run" menu and select "Run Configurations..."
Click on "Eclipse Application" on the left hand side, 
then click the "New Launch Configuration" button above that list.
On the "Main" page, change "Run a product" to "com.google.dart.tools.deploy.product"
On the "Plug-ins" page ...
    Change "Launch with:" to "plug-ins selected below only".
    Click "Deselect all"
    Select "com.google.dart.tools.ui"
    Click "Add Required Plug-ins".
    Click "Validate plug-ins automatically prior to launching".
Click "Run" and another instance of Eclipse should launch, running the Dart Editor!

====================================
  Dart Editor Options
====================================

Dart Editor has some internal options for adjusting what information is logged
and what technology is used when compiling and launching Dart source.
See dart/editor/tools/plugins/com.google.dart.tools.core/.options

====================================
  Building the Dart Editor
====================================

Setup your <username>.properties file as described above in "Installing Dart SDK and Dartium"

In a similar fashion create a new <username>.<build-os>.properties file in the same directory
as the <username>.properties file with content copied from chrome-bot.<build-os>.properties

Run the build_rcp.xml ant script in the com.google.dart.tools.deploy.feature_releng project

    ant -f build_rcp.xml -Dbuild.os=<os>
  where <os> is one of
    linux
    macos
    win32

It will create Windows, Linux, and Mac builds in the 'out' directory
of the build directory specified above.

====================================
  Build/Run Dart Editor Tests
====================================

After building the Dart editor as described above,
run the buildTests.xml ant script in the com.google.dart.tools.tests.feature_releng project

    ant -f buildTests.xml -Dbuild.os=<os>
  where <os> is one of
    linux
    macos
    win32

====================================
  Running SWTBot UI tests (deprecated)
====================================

Install SWTBot (see optional installation step above)
Import com.google.dart.tools.ui.swtbot_test (if not already imported)

    <Bug platform="Mac">
      Bug Description: (Mac only): 
        There is a bug when running SWTBot in Eclipse 3.7.0 on Mac 10.6.8 (and others?)
        Key events posted with Display.post() do not honor Shift key state
        https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=363309
      Workaround:
        If the SWTBot tests cannot successfully drive the open file dialog
          (fails to auto-type uppercase characters),
        then ...
          Open the "Plug-ins" view
          Select "org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64"
          Import As > Source Project
          Edit org.eclipse.swt.internal.cocoa.OS.java
            Replace
              public static final int kCGSessionEventTap = 1;
            with
              public static final int kCGHIDEventTap = 0;
          Edit org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display
            Replace
              OS.CGEventPost(OS.kCGSessionEventTap, eventRef);
            with
              OS.CGEventPost(OS.kCGHIDEventTap, eventRef);
     </Bug>

Right click on src/com.google.dart.tools.ui.swtbot.DartEditorUiTest
