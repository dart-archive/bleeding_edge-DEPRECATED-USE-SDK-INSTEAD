 * its output buffer for responses.  The server should continue to train its
 * input buffer even though its output buffer is full.
 *
 * Once enough commands have been sent, we begin reading from the server's
 * output buffer, and verify that it responds to the last command.
 *
 * NB.
 *
 * This test was intentionally disabled, because after r43123 server
 * writes to stdout synchronously. So, now it is the client's responsibility
 * to read stdout in a timely manner to avoid blocking the server.
