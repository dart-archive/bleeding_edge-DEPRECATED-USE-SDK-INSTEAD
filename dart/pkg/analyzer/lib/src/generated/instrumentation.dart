/**
 * The class `Instrumentation` implements support for logging instrumentation information.
 *
 * Instrumentation information consists of information about specific operations. Those operations
 * can range from user-facing operations, such as saving the changes to a file, to internal
 * operations, such as tokenizing source code. The information to be logged is gathered by
 * [InstrumentationBuilder], created by one of the static methods on
 * this class such as [builder] or [builder].
 *
 * Note, however, that until an instrumentation logger is installed using the method
 * [setLogger], all instrumentation data will be lost.
 *
 * <b>Example</b>
 *
 * To collect metrics about how long it took to save a file, you would write something like the
 * following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * InstrumentationBuilder instrumentation = Instrumentation.builder(this.getClass());
 * // save the file
 * instrumentation.metric("chars", fileLength).log();
 * </pre>
 * The `Instrumentation.builder` method creates a new [InstrumentationBuilder
 ] and records the time at which it was created. The
 * [InstrumentationBuilder#metric] appends the information specified by the
 * arguments and records the time at which the method is called so that the time to complete the
 * save operation can be calculated. The `log` method tells the builder that all of the data
 * has been collected and that the resulting information should be logged.
