# changelog

This file contains highlights of what changes on each version of the polymer
package. We will also note important changes to the polyfill packages if they
impact polymer: custom_element, html_import, observe, shadow_dom,
and template_binding.

#### Pub version 0.10.0-dev
  * The output of pub-build no longer uses mirrors. We replace all uses of
    mirrors with code generation.
  * Interop with polymer-js elements now works.
  * Polymer polyfills are now consolidated in package:web_components, which is
    identical to platform.js from http://polymer-project.org.
  * Breaking change: "noscript" polymer-elements are created by polymer.js, and
    therefore cannot be extended (subtyped) in Dart. They can still be used
    by Dart elements or applications, however.
  * New feature: `@ObserveProperty('foo bar.baz') myMethod() {...}` will cause
    myMethod to be called when "foo" or "bar.baz" changes.
  * Updated for 0.10.0-dev package:observe and package:template_binding changes.
  * Deploy step removes use of mirrors to initialize polymer elements. Mirrors
    are still used for @published and for polymer-expressions.
    **breaking change**: @initMethod and @CustomTag are only supported on
    public classes/methods.
