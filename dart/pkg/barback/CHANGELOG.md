## 0.12.0

* Add a `Transform.logger.fine` function that doesn't print its messages by
  default. When using Barback with pub in verbose mode, these messages will be
  printed.

* Add a `Transform.hasInput` function that returns whether or not a given
  secondary input exists.

* `Transformer.allowedExtensions` now supports extensions containing multiple
  periods, such as `.dart.js`.

* Transforms now pass their primary inputs through to the next phase by default.
  A transformer may still overwrite its primary input without causing a
  collision. If a transformer doesn't overwrite its primary input, it may cause
  it not to be passed through by calling `Transform.consumePrimary`. The primary
  input will be consumed by default if a transformer throws an error.

* If an input requested with `Transform.getInput`, `Transform.readInput`, or
  `Transform.readInputAsString` cannot be found, an `AssetNotFoundException`
  will be thrown. This was always what the documentation said, but previously a
  `MissingInputException` was thrown instead.

* If a transformer calls `Transform.logger.error`, the transformer will now be
  considered to have failed after it finishes running `apply()`. This means that
  its outputs will not be consumed by future transformers and its primary input
  will not be passed through to the next phase.

* If a transform calls `Transform.getInput`, `Transform.readInput`,
  `Transform.readInputAsString`, or `Transform.hasInput` on an input that
  doesn't exist, the transform will be re-run if that input is created in the
  future.
