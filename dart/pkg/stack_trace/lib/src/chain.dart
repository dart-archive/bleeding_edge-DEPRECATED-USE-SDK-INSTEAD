/// A function that handles errors in the zone wrapped by [Chain.capture].
typedef void ChainHandler(error, Chain chain);

/// A chain of stack traces.
///
/// A stack chain is a collection of one or more stack traces that collectively
/// represent the path from [main] through nested function calls to a particular
/// code location, usually where an error was thrown. Multiple stack traces are
/// necessary when using asynchronous functions, since the program's stack is
/// reset before each asynchronous callback is run.
///
/// Stack chains can be automatically tracked using [Chain.capture]. This sets
/// up a new [Zone] in which the current stack chain is tracked and can be
/// accessed using [new Chain.current]. Any errors that would be top-leveled in
/// the zone can be handled, along with their associated chains, with the
/// `onError` callback. For example:
///
///     Chain.capture(() {
///       // ...
///     }, onError: (error, stackChain) {
///       print("Caught error $error\n"
///             "$stackChain");
///     });
///
/// For the most part [Chain.capture] will notice when an error is thrown and
/// associate the correct stack chain with it; the chain can be accessed using
/// [new Chain.forTrace]. However, there are some cases where exceptions won't
/// be automatically detected: any [Future] constructor,
/// [Completer.completeError], [Stream.addError], and libraries that use these.
/// For these, all you need to do is wrap the Future or Stream in a call to
/// [Chain.track] and the errors will be tracked correctly.

  ///
  /// If [onError] is passed, any error in the zone that would otherwise go
  /// unhandled is passed to it, along with the [Chain] associated with that
  /// error. Note that if [callback] produces multiple unhandled errors,
  /// [onError] may be called more than once. If [onError] isn't passed, the
  /// parent Zone's `unhandledErrorHandler` will be called with the error and
  /// its chain.

  /// For the most part an error thrown in the zone will have the correct stack
  /// chain associated with it. However, there are some cases where exceptions

  /// considered unhandled.
