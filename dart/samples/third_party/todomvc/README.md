TodoMVC sample application written with web-components and templates bound to
models.

To run this code, launch `web/out/_main.html.html`. If this file does not exist
yet, right click on "build.dart" and select "Run".

Generated code will start with an underscore. Any time you edit and save a
source file, the necessary files will be regenerated automatically. Look at
`build.dart` to see how this works.

You can also find this example on the development site for Dart web components:
