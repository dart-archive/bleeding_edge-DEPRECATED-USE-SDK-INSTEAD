/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
 NSPR I/O layer that terminates in a pair of circular buffers
 rather than talking to the real network.
 To use this with NSS:
 1) call memio_CreateIOLayer to create a fake NSPR socket
 2) call SSL_ImportFD to ssl-ify the socket
 3) Do your own networking calls to set up a TCP connection
 4) call memio_SetPeerName to tell NSS about the other end of the connection
 5) While at the same time doing plaintext nonblocking NSPR I/O as
    usual to the nspr file descriptor returned by SSL_ImportFD,
    your app must shuttle encrypted data between
    the real network and memio's network buffers.
    memio_GetReadParams/memio_PutReadResult
    are the hooks you need to pump data into memio's input buffer,
    and memio_GetWriteParams/memio_PutWriteResult
    are the hooks you need to pump data out of memio's output buffer.
