Dart Observatory Developer Guide
---

Assumptions:
You are running pub from the latest dev channel release of Dart Editor.

During development you do not need to run dart2js or rebuild the VM (unless
you are also making changes to the backend). While you're working on your
feature follow the steps:

1. Open runtime/bin/vmservice/client in the Dart Editor
2. Run pub upgrade
3. Launch dart --enable-vm-service --pause-isolates-on-exit script.dart
4. Launch web/index.html in Dartium

At this point you should see the initial Observatory UI and that
it is communicating with the VM you launched in step 2.

Continue to develop and iterate until you're ready to upload your change
for review. Upload your change and get an LGTM.

5. Run pub build
6. Run ./deploy.sh
7. If you have added new resource files (images, html files) you must run
resources.sh and use its output to update resources_sources.gypi (Standalone)
and devtools.gypi (Dartium).

At this point you should rebuild your VM and using the build:

8. Launch dart --enable-vm-service --pause-isolates-on-exit script.dart

In a non-Dart enabled browser navigate to localhost:8181 and ensure
that your feature works after being compiled to JavaScript.

9. Commit your change
