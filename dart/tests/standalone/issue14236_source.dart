// This is the original dart program that was used to generate the snapshot
// in file issue14236_test.dart
// The original test/main has been commented out and we have a test/main which
// throws an error to ensure that this file is not executed as part of the
// test.
//
// When issue14236_test.dart fails, you must regenerate it using the VM
// with your changes. You should understand what in your change makes
// regeneration of the snapshot necessary.
// Steps for regenerating:
// 1) Swap the test and main functions below.
// 2) $ ./xcodebuild/DebugIA32/dart --package-root=./xcodebuild/DebugIA32/packages --snapshot=tests/standalone/issue14236_test.dart tests/standalone/issue14236_source.dart
// 3) Undo changes in 1.
