/**
 * The `ng-if` directive compliments the `ng-unless` (provided by

 *
 * directive based on the **truthy/falsy** value of the provided expression.
 * Specifically, if the expression assigned to `ng-if` evaluates to a `false`
 * value, then the subtree is removed from the DOM.  Otherwise, *a clone of the
 * subtree* is reinserted into the DOM.  This clone is created from the compiled
 * state.  As such, modifications made to the element after compilation (e.g.
 * changing the `class`) are lost when the element is destroyed.
 *
 * Whenever the subtree is inserted into the DOM, it always gets a new child
 * scope.  This child scope is destroyed when the subtree is removed from the
 * DOM.  Refer
 * https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/The-Nuances-of-Scope-prototypical-Inheritance prototypical inheritance
 *
 * This has an important implication when `ng-model` is used inside an `ng-if`
 * to bind to a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope.  In such a
 * situation, any modifications made to the variable in the `ng-if` subtree will
 * be made on the child scope and override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 * The parent scope will remain unchanged by changes affected by this subtree.
 *
 * Note: `ng-if` differs from `ng-show` and `ng-hide` in that `ng-if` completely
 * removes and recreates the element in the DOM rather than changing its
 * visibility via the `display` css property.  A common case when this
 * difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an
 * element's position within the DOM (HTML), such as the `:first-child` or
 * `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <!-- By using ng-if instead of ng-show, we avoid the cost of the showdown
 *          filter, the repeater, etc. -->
 *     <div ng-if="showDetails">
 *        {{obj.details.markdownText | showdown}}
 *        <div ng-repeat="item in obj.details.items">
 *          ...
