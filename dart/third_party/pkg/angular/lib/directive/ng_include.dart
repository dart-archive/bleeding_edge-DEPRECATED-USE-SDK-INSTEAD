part of angular.directive;

/**
 * Fetches, compiles and includes an external Angular template/HTML.
 *
 * A new child [Scope] is created for the included DOM subtree.
 *
 * [NgIncludeDirective] provides only one small part of the power of
 * [NgComponent].  Consider using directives and components instead as they
 * provide this feature as well as much more.
 *
 * Note: The browser's Same Origin Policy (<http://v.gd/5LE5CA>) and
 * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy (<http://v.gd/nXoY8y>) restrict
 * whether the template is successfully loaded.  For example,
 * [NgIncludeDirective] won't work for cross-domain requests on all browsers and
 * for `file://` access on some browsers.
