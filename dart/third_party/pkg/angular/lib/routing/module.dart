/**
 * The [routing] library makes it easier to build large single-page
 * applications. The library lets you map the browser address bar to semantic
 * structure of your application and keeps them in sync.
 *
 * Angular uses the [route_hierarchical] package to define application routes
 * and to provide custom tools to make it easier to use routing with Angular
 * templates.
 *
 * Lets consider a simple recipe book application. The application might have
 * the following pages:
 *
 *   * recipes list/search
 *   * add new recipe
 *   * view recipe
 *   * edit recipe
 *
 * Each of those pages can be represented by an address:
 *
 *   * `/recipes`
 *   * `/addRecipe`
 *   * `/recipe/:recipeId/view`
 *   * `/recipe/:recipeId/edit`
 *
 *
 * Lets try to define those routes in Angular. To get started we need to
 * provide an implementation of [RouteInitializerFn] function.
 *
 *    void initRoutes(Router router, ViewFactory view) {
 *       // define routes here.
 *    }
 *
 *     var module = new Module()
 *       ..factory(RouteInitializerFn, (_) => initRoutes);
 *
 *  Lets see how we could define our routes using the routing framework:
 *
 *     void initRoutes(Router router, ViewFactory view) {
 *       router
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'recipes',
 *            path: '/recipes',
 *            enter: view('recipes.html'))
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'addRecipe',
 *            path: '/addRecipe',
 *            enter: view('addRecipe.html'))
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'viewRecipe',
 *            path: '/recipe/:recipeId/view',
 *            enter: view('viewRecipe.html'))
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'editRecipe',
 *            path: '/recipe/:recipeId/edit',
 *            enter: view('editRecipe.html'));
 *     }
 *
 *  We defined 4 routes and for each route we set views (templates) to be
 *  displayed when that route is "entered". For example, when the browser URL
 *  is set to `/recipes`, the `recipes.html` will be displayed.
 *
 *  You have to tell Angular where to load views by putting `<ng-view>` tag in
 *  you template.
 *
 *  Notice that `viewRecipe` and `editRecipe` route paths have `recipeId`
 *  parameter in them. We need to be able to get hold of that parameter in
 *  order to know which recipe to load. Lets consider the following
 *  `viewRecipe.html`.
 *
 *      <view-recipe></view-recipe>
 *
 *  The template contains a custom `view-recipe` component that handles
 *  displaying the recipe. Now, our `view-recipe` can inject [RouteProvider]
 *  to get hold of the route and its parameters. It might look like this:
 *
 *      @NgComponent(...)
 *      class ViewRecipeComponent {
 *        ViewRecipeComponent(RouteProvider routeProvider) {
 *          String recipeId = routeProvider.parameters['recipeId'];
 *          _loadRecipe(recipeId);
 *        }
 *      }
 *
 *  [RouteProvider] and [Route] can be used to control navigation, specifically,
 *  leaving of the route. For example, lets consider "edit recipe" component:
 *
 *      @NgComponent(...)
 *      class EditRecipeComponent implements NgDetachAware {
 *        RouteHandle route;
 *        EditRecipeComponent(RouteProvider routeProvider) {
 *          RouteHandle route = routeProvider.route.newHandle();
 *          _loadRecipe(route);
 *          route.onLeave.listen((RouteEvent event) {
 *            event.allowLeave(_checkIfOkToLeave());
 *          });
 *        }
 *
 *        /// Check if the editor has unsaved contents and if necessary ask
 *        /// the user if OK to leave this page.
 *        Future<bool> _checkIfOkToLeave() {/* ... */}
 *
 *        detach() {
 *          route.discard();
 *        }
 *      }
 *
 *  [Route.onLeave] event is triggered when the browser is routed from an
 *  active route to a different route. The active route can delay and
 *  potentially veto the navigation by passing a [Future<bool>] to
 *  [RouteEvent.allowLeave].
 *
 *  Notice that we create a [RouteHandle] for our route. [RouteHandle] are
 *  a convinient wrapper around [Route] that makes unsubscribing route events
 *  easier. For example, notice that we didn't need to manually call
 *  [StreamSubscription.cancel] for subscription to [Route.onLeave]. Calling
 *  [RouteHandle.discard] unsubscribes all listeneters created for the handle.
 *
 *
 *  # Hierarchical Routes
 *
 *  The routing framework allows us to define trees of routes. In our recipes
 *  example we could have defined our routes like this:
 *
 *     void initRoutes(Router router, ViewFactory view) {
 *       router
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'recipes',
 *            path: '/recipes',
 *            enter: view('recipes.html'))
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'addRecipe',
 *            path: '/addRecipe',
 *            enter: view('addRecipe.html'))
 *         ..addRoute(
 *            name: 'recipe',
 *            path: '/recipe/:recipeId',
 *            mount: (Route route) => route
 *               ..addRoute(
 *                  name: 'view',
 *                  path: '/view',
 *                  enter: view('viewRecipe.html'))
 *               ..addRoute(
 *                  name: 'edit',
 *                  path: '/edit',
 *                  enter: view('editRecipe.html')));
 *     }
 *   }
